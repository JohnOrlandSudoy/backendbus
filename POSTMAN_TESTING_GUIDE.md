# üß™ Postman Testing Guide for Notification System

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Postman installed** on your machine
2. **Server running** on `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Database updated** with the new notification schema
4. **Valid user UUIDs** for testing

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Import the Collection
1. Open Postman
2. Click **Import** button
3. Select the `Notification_API_Postman_Collection.json` file
4. The collection will appear in your workspace

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
1. Click on the collection name
2. Go to **Variables** tab
3. Update the following variables:

```json
{
  "base_url": "http://localhost:3000",
  "admin_user_id": "your-actual-admin-uuid",
  "client_user_id": "your-actual-client-uuid", 
  "employee_user_id": "your-actual-employee-uuid",
  "notification_id": "leave-empty-initially"
}
```

## üîî Testing Admin Endpoints

### **Step 1: Test Basic Connectivity**

   - Expected: `200 OK` with message "Notification routing is working!"

### **Step 2: Create Test Notifications**
1. **"Send Notification to Single User"**
   - Update `client_user_id` variable with a real UUID
   - Run the request
   - Expected: `201 Created` with notification details
   - **Copy the returned notification ID** to `notification_id` variable

2. **"Send Notification to Specific Users"**
   - Update both `client_user_id` and `employee_user_id`
   - Run the request
   - Expected: `201 Created` with message "Notifications sent to 2 recipient(s)"

3. **"Broadcast to All Clients"**
   - Run the request
   - Expected: `201 Created` with message "Broadcast notification sent to X client(s)"

### **Step 3: View and Analyze**

   - Expected: `200 OK` with counts, distributions, and daily stats

## üë§ Testing Client Endpoints

### **Step 1: View Client Notifications**
1. **"Get Client Notifications"**
   - Ensure `client_user_id` is set correctly
   - Run with filters: `type=announcement`, `is_read=false`, `priority=high`
   - Expected: `200 OK` with filtered notifications

2. **"Get Client Notifications - All Types"**
   - Run without type filtering
   - Expected: `200 OK` with all notifications for the client

### **Step 2: Test Read Operations**
1. **"Mark Notification as Read"**
   - Ensure `notification_id` is set to a real notification ID
   - Run the request
   - Expected: `200 OK` with updated notification (is_read: true)

2. **"Mark All Notifications as Read"**
   - Run to mark all unread notifications as read
   - Expected: `200 OK` with count of updated notifications

### **Step 3: Test Delete Operations**
1. **"Delete Specific Notification"**
   - Set `notification_id` to a notification you want to delete
   - Run the request
   - Expected: `200 OK` with message "Notification deleted successfully"

2. **"Delete All Read Notifications"**
   - Run to clean up read notifications
   - Expected: `200 OK` with count of deleted notifications

### **Step 4: Check Unread Count**
1. **"Get Unread Count"**
   - Run to see current unread count
   - Expected: `200 OK` with `unreadCount` field

## üë∑ Testing Employee Endpoints

### **Step 1: View Employee Notifications**
1. **"Get Employee Notifications"**
   - Ensure `employee_user_id` is set correctly

   - Expected: `200 OK` with filtered notifications

2. **"Get Employee Notifications - All Types"**
   - Run without type filtering
   - Expected: `200 OK` with all notifications for the employee

### **Step 2: Test Read Operations**
1. **"Mark Employee Notification as Read"**
   - Set `notification_id` to a real notification ID
   - Run the request
   - Expected: `200 OK` with updated notification

## üîç Testing Utility Endpoints

### **Step 1: Admin Recipient View**
1. **"Get Notifications by Recipient ID (Admin View)"**
   - Set recipient ID in URL path
   - Run with filters
   - Expected: `200 OK` with paginated notifications for specific user

### **Step 2: Specific Notification View**
1. **"Get Specific Notification by ID (Admin View)"**
   - Set `notification_id` to a real notification ID
   - Run the request
   - Expected: `200 OK` with notification details including recipient info
